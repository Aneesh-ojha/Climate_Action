                Climate change refers to long-term shifts in Earth's average temperatures and weather patterns, primarily driven by human activities like burning fossil fuels. These activities release greenhouse gases, trapping heat and causing the planet to warm. The consequences include rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems and human health.

                Human Influence:
Scientists widely agree that human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels, are the primary cause of recent climate change.

            <p class="subtitle">
                Impacts:
These include rising global temperatures, melting glaciers and ice caps, rising sea levels, changes in precipitation patterns (more droughts in some areas, more floods in others), and more frequent and intense extreme weather events.

            <p class="subtitle">
                Consequences:
Climate change poses risks to human health (through extreme weather events and changes in disease patterns), ecosystems (through habitat loss and species extinctions), food security (through droughts and floods), and economies (through damage from extreme weather and changes in agricultural production).

                Mitigation and Adaptation:
                Reducing greenhouse gas emissions (mitigation) and preparing for the unavoidable impacts of climate change (adaptation) are crucial steps in addressing this global challenge.
