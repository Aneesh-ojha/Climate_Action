            <p class="subtitle">
                Nearly all land areas are seeing more hot days and heat waves; 2020 was one of the hottest years on record. 
                Higher temperatures increase heat-related illnesses and can make it more difficult to work and move around. 
                Wildfires start more easily and spread more rapidly when conditions are hotter.
              </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="subtitle">
                Changes in temperature cause changes in rainfall. This results in more severe and frequent storms. 
                They cause flooding and landslides, destroying homes and communities, and costing billions of dollars.
              </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="subtitle">
                Water is becoming scarcer in more regions. 
                Droughts can stir destructive sand and dust storms that can move billions of tons of sand across continents. 
                Deserts are expanding, reducing land for growing food. 
                Many people now face the threat of not having enough water on a regular basis.
              </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="subtitle">
                The ocean soaks up most of the heat from global warming. 
                This melts ice sheets and raises sea levels, threatening coastal and island communities. 
                The ocean also absorbs carbon dioxide, keeping it from the atmosphere. 
                More carbon dioxide makes the ocean more acidic, which endangers marine life.
              </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="subtitle">
                Changes in climate and increases in extreme weather events are among the reasons behind a global rise in hunger and poor nutrition. 
                Fisheries, crops, and livestock may be destroyed or become less productive.
                Heat stress can diminish water and grasslands for grazing.
              </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="subtitle">
                The Arctic is warming at least twice as fast as the rest of the world, leading to rapid loss of sea ice and permafrost thaw.
                This accelerates global warming further by releasing stored methane, a potent greenhouse gas.
              </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="subtitle">
                Climate change is causing species to migrate or adapt, but many cannot keep pace with the rapid changes.
                Scientists estimate that 1 million species are at risk of extinction due to climate change and other human activities.
              </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="subtitle">
                Rising temperatures are expanding the range of disease-carrying insects like mosquitoes and ticks,
                leading to increased spread of illnesses such as malaria, dengue fever, and Lyme disease.
              </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="subtitle">
                Climate change threatens global food security by reducing crop yields and nutritional quality.
                Staple crops like wheat, rice, and maize could see significant declines in production by 2050.
              </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p class="subtitle">
                The last decade (2011-2020) was the warmest on record, with each of the last four decades being warmer than any previous decade since 1850.
                The global average temperature is now about 1.1Â°C higher than in the late 19th century.
